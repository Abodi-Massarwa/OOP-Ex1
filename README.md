                                                 Summary of Ex1
This repository has 4 base classes: Monom, Polynom, ComplexFunction and GUI. it can be used to build functions such as Monoms Polynoms and complex's(a function that has left function, right function and an operator), and draw them to the screen with the GUI class.
In general we expand the Ex0,through comp function that is a complex function “f(g)” also we drawing this function.
Also we do JunitTest to Monom and Polynom function according to what we learned in lesson.
In StdDraw we helped in codes from moodle and we changed in this code to draw the graphs of the functions.
